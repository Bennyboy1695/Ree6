# What is Ree6?
Ree6 is an all-in-one Discord Bot maintained by Presti, which started as an alternative of Mee6 to provide a lot of features that are hidden behind a paywall or subscription.

# What can Ree6 do?
As of right now Ree6 has the ability to play Music freely from YouTube, Spotify and Soundcloud.
As well as the "default" moderation ability such as ban, kick etc., Ree6 also provides its own implementation of the Audit-Logger.
We also provide an **open-Source** Webinterface, Twitch and Twitter Notification, a Leveling System, a public Rest-API and more!

# Discord
Ree6 has its own support Discord that you can join to help us reach the Partner status on Discord and you to get help!
